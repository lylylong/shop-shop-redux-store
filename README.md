# Shop-shop Redux Store

## Description

As a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform, I want my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API. So my website's state management is taken out of the React. Let's see how this app works:

- This is an e-commerce platform that uses Redux to manage global state, when I review the appâ€™s store, I can find that the app uses a Redux store instead of the Context API.

- When I review the way the React front end accesses the store, I can find that the app uses a Redux provider. When I review the way the app determines changes to its global state, I can find that the app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API.

- When I review the way the app extracts state data from the store, I can find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API. When I review the way the app dispatches actions, I can find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API.
